                    <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        After taking Web Programming in college at Georgia State
                        University, I fell in love with Front-End Web
                        Development.
                        This particular course covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        and PHP. I was able to get a good grasp on the
                        foundational aspects of Web Programming
                        and was able to further utilize and enhance my skills in
                        my Software Engineering course. I specifically worked on
                        Front-End projects such as
                        the popular Game of Life, which allowed me to understand
                        the fundamentals of JavaScript and how it is
                        incorporated with HTML and CSS. I also was able to
                        experience development utilizing React for allowing
                        users to add and delete desired spotify songs on a
                        Spotify Song Randomizer website created for my Software
                        Engineering course. Overall, Front-End work is
                        considered a strong suit of mine, and I would love to
                        continue to learn more about it.

                    <p>
                        My bachelor's degree at Georgia State University allowed me to gain most of
                        my knowledge on Back-End development. 
                        A substantial amount of my learning was attained by a Meta engineer whom taught my Software Engineering course at my University and encouraged me to work on my most vital extracurricular work I have today. 
                        This allowed me to grasp my key back-end engineering abilities with Verison Control, RESTful APIs, Databases, Python, and various Frameworks.  
                        I then expanded on my back-end knowledge with team work by creating a website named "FoodFight" which allows for users to create groups and decide which restaurants to eat at based on their ratings. This made use of Yelp's Rest API, and used a
                        lot of back-end work using Flask, Flask Login, PostgreSQL, and Python.

                <p>
                    My Computer Science expertise was rooted from my deep interest in Graphic Design.
                    I always marveled at companies that constructed brilliant technology with exceedingly good design. I attended an art high school and majored in visual arts to learn more about design
                    and further expanded my education in college by majoring in graphic design. After a couple of semesters, I took up web development as an extracurricular and realized I had a passion for the way programming
                    and design coexist. Programming was enjoyable for me and it only seemed necessary to switch my major to computer science.  I delve into back-end work with my web development and software engineering courses. 
                    These courses gave me enough ability to further do freelance work and create websites for friends and family. 
                    I then finished college at Georgia State University in 2021 with a bachelors in computer science and am now looking in the job market for a software engineering role. 
                    I am a results driven, meticulous worker and am excited to see where the software engineering field will take me.
