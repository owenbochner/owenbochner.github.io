                    <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        After taking Web Programming in college at Georgia State
                        University, I fell in love with Front-End Web
                        Development.
                        This particular course covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        and PHP. I was able to get a good grasp on the
                        foundational aspects of Web Programming
                        and was able to further utilize and enhance my skills in
                        my Software Engineering course. I specifically worked on
                        Front-End projects such as
                        the popular Game of Life, which allowed me to understand
                        the fundamentals of JavaScript and how it is
                        incorporated with HTML and CSS. I also was able to
                        experience development utilizing React for allowing
                        users to add and delete desired spotify songs on a
                        Spotify Song Randomizer website created for my Software
                        Engineering course. Overall, Front-End work is
                        considered a strong suit of mine, and I would love to
                        continue to learn more about it.

                    <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        My bachelor's degree at Georgia State University allowed me to gain most of
                        my knowledge on Back-End development. 
                        A substantial amount of my learning was attained by a Meta engineer whom taught my Software Engineering course at my University and encouraged me to work on my most vital extracurricular work I have today. 
                        This allowed me to grasp my key back-end engineering abilities with Verison Control, RESTful APIs, Databases, Python, and various Frameworks.  
                        I then expanded on my back-end knowledge with team work by creating a website named "FoodFight" which allows for users to create groups and decide which restaurants to eat at based on their ratings. This made use of Yelp's Rest API, and used a
                        lot of back-end work using Flask, Flask Login, PostgreSQL, and Python.

                    My Computer Science expertise was rooted from my deep interest in Graphic Design.
                    I always marveled at companies that constructed brilliant technology with exceedingly good design. 
                    It only seemed necessary for me to build off of my design and artistic knowledge by studying graphic design as art was always a large part of who I was and still am. 
                    Only until later I delve into web development and found how much programming contributed to the web design I cared for. 
                    This lead me to take a web development course at Georgia State University, which then pushed me to learn not only front-end web development but also back-end. 
                    I then proceeded to expand my knowledge with freelance work by creating websites for friends and family.
